I am a Software Engineer, and my research is focused on building high quality software and data analysis pipelines for large scale genomic data and leveraging novel and existing bioinformatics tools to uncover the fundamental tools that microorganisms use to perform tasks that impact human health. My background is deeply interdisciplinary with my current career focus on bioinformatics generally, including the development of novel tools, and the implementation of complex data analysis pipelines on large scale genomic data. I have a particular interest in tackling research questions that have been previously inaccessible due to resource constraints, lack of fundamentally descriptive data, or unavailable computational toolkits.
